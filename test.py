OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model is the latest in a series of large language models trained to understand and generate human-like text.
It can summarize, translate, answer questions, write stories, and perform many other language tasks. In addition, GPT-4 is multimodal, 
accepting both image and text inputs, making it a powerful general-purpose AI system. Organizations use GPT-4 across industries for automation, support, content creation, and more.
